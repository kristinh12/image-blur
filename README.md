Image Blur

Image blur is an algorithm that can take an array of 0s and 1s, and change any adjacent value of 1 to also be 1. You can also specify to change all values within a manhattan distance of the "1." I have two solutions to do this, image-blur3.rb (uses nested loops) and image-blur3-alternate.rb (uses recursion).  

Tests
image-blur3_spec.rb
image-blur3-alternate_spec.rb
